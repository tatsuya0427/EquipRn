### Getting Started
1. Creating the layer `SelectableInversion`
2. Add the `SelectableInversion` component to your main camera

The script is contained under the `QFSW.SIIE` namespace

### Settings
 - **Use Colored Inversion** causes the image to approach a user specified color as the inversion approaches 50%, instead of the gray that would otherwise be achieved by combining an inverted image with a non inverted image
 - **Use Mask Color** will use the color of the mask at that pixel for the mid inversion color instead of a constant user defined color
 - **Clear Color** controls which color the Inversion Camera will clear to; you can also think of this as the default inversion value
